Cypress Quick Playtime
Been a few years since I last played with this framework

Goals
- Wanting to see if I can use typescript for type validation
- Operating on a website with issues (TodoMVC.com)
- Classic test of creation of two Todo's and editing of them

If time allows later
- Move the reused methods to a Page Object model
- Look at other options to ignore the errors on loading the TodoMVC.com website
- Would want to have a play with some of the new features that reduce cross origin issues

Initial thoughts
- Development Environment was pretty good. Debugging was relatively easy
- Playwright's API may be a bit more user friendly (more generic functions for text extraction)

NOTE: tsconfig was initialised using
"npx tsc --init --types cypress -lib dom,es6"
